The RTO represents the time it takes for the database to recover and be fully functional in the event of AZ outage.
1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage:
With a Multi-AZ configuration, RTO can be minimized as the database is replicated synchronously to the standby database
from the primary one. The exact time of failover process depends on the size of database and connection, mostly within.
few minutes
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage:
Recovering from a regional outage involves the failover of the entire database to new region. The process includes
provisioning new resources, restoring data, redirecting traffic. Depending on the complexity of database, the RTO can
be from several minutes to hours.

The RPO indicates the maximum amount of data loss during the recovery process when AZ outage happens.
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage:
Same as the RTO for a single AZ outage, since the database is replicated synchronously and in real-time, the achievable
RPO is relatively low. Data replication process can be transparent and result in minimal data loss, generally within
seconds or milliseconds.
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
The achievement of RPO depends on the mechanism of data replication between regions. With asynchronous mechanism, data
loss amount can be determined by replication lag. On the other hand, with synchronous one, the RPO can be relatively low
similar to the RPO of a single AZ outage.
